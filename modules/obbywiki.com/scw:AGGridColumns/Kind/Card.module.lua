require('strict')

--- 'card' kind — a compact entity cell (thumbnail + eyebrow + title) rendered by
--- the gadget's scwEntityCard type. Generalised from PledgeVehicleGrid's buildCard.
--- Spec: { field, header, titleLabel, imageLabel?, filter?, filterOn?, pinned?,
---         width? | (flex?, minWidth?),
---         eyebrow? = fun(result): { text, full?, href?, icon? }|nil }.
--- Sizing is either fixed (`width`) or flexible (`flex`, with `minWidth` as its
--- floor) so the card can absorb a grid's leftover horizontal space.
--- The eyebrow resolver is consumer-supplied (e.g. PledgeVehicleGrid maps a
--- manufacturer to its short name + brand glyph), so this kind stays generic.
--- `filterOn` ('title'|'eyebrow') tells the gadget which packed field the filter
--- keys on; unset = the gadget default (eyebrow, falling back to title).
