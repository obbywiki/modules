--- 'signedBar' kind — a signed number drawn as a bar growing from a centre line,
--- rendered by the gadget's scwSignedBar type. For columns of signed deltas whose
--- SIGN alone does not say good or bad: a mining module's resistance +15% is a
--- penalty while its shatter damage −30% is a benefit, so a reader who does not
--- already know each stat's polarity cannot skim the column.
---
--- `good` names the direction that helps, and the bar leans that way regardless of
--- sign — a −80% overcharge rate and a +100% charge window both lean right. Omit
--- `good` for a stat with no inherent good side: the bar then leans by sign and is
--- drawn neutral.
---
--- Bar length is the value's share of `max`, which the consumer computes across the
--- whole column (see Module:DataGrid) and which the gadget reads off the colDef as
--- `scwBarMax`. Scaling on the column rather than per cell is what makes two rows
--- comparable at a glance; it deliberately does not rescale when rows are filtered,
--- so a bar means the same thing before and after.
---
--- Spec: { field, header, label, good? ('higher'|'lower'), max, width? }.
